					<h2>Great comedy movie with cute Jewish men</h2>
					<h3>muslimbellydancer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25 November 2015</h3>
					<p>Fourteen years prior, Ethan Miller's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) parents passed away on Christmas Eve. His two best friends, Isaac (Seth Rogen) and Chris (Anthony Mackie), have been with him in support on this night by having an annual tradition of going out on Christmas Eve. However, because Isaac is going to be a father and Chris has become famous, all three decide to have one last Christmas Eve out in New York City.</p>
					<p>I absolutely loved this movie so did my son Muhammad because it is so funny and done well. I am a Muslim woman and I celebrate Christmas too with my only one beloved son Muhammad.</p>
					<p>Honestly the Jewish men were so cute and funny they really made me laugh from start to finish.</p>

					<h2>A hilarious holiday comedy that ISN'T about the holidays</h2>
					<h3>d_stack04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24 November 2015</h3>
					<p>I'm of the opinion that after beauty, comedy is the most subjective thing in the world. Some things that make one person laugh is not guaranteed to make EVERYONE laugh. Nothing is universally funny, even Family Guy. People hate it, myself included. So having said that I get why some people don't find Seth Rogen funny. He never plays too far from type, at least in his comedic roles, so I get why people say he plays the same character over and over. He does, kinda. But I think he's hilarious. But The Night Before is not your typical Seth Rogen comedy. Sure, this movie has the trademark crude humor of Rogen but this movie has one thing many of his comedies don't: heart.</p>
					<p>The Night Before tells the tale of Ethan (Gordon-Levitt) who suffered the tragic loss of his parents on Christmas Eve as a young adult. That year and every year since his surrogate family in the form of best friends Isaac (Rogen) and Chris (Mackie) has held a tradition of going out and partying, in constant pursuit of the illustrious "Nutcracker Ball." On the year the friends agree to end the tradition, Ethan stumbles upon tickets to the Nutcracker Ball and the story goes from there.</p>
					<p>This script was from a story by the film's director Jonathan Levine. If you haven't seen his previous films like 50/50 or Warm Bodies, I highly recommend doing so. This guy can balance comedic moments sewn into a dramatic story, especially in 50/50. And that's what the story of this movie is, dramatic. First off, this movie has almost nothing to do with the holiday season. No character goes through an arc where their lesson is taught by the magic of Christmas. This is a buddy comedy set during the holiday season. It's a tale of friendships and how they evolve over the years. And at this point in their lives, their mid 30s, they're growing more apart by the day. By the end of the film, all three men realizing keeping the friendship together is hard so that means they'll simply have to work harder at it.</p>
